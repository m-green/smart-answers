###What happens next

The British embassy will display your notice <%= calculator.partner_is_opposite_sex? ? 'of marriage' : 'for civil partnership' %> publicly for 7 days.

They'll issue your CNI within 5 working days of the end of the 7-day notice period (as long as nobody has registered an objection). You can collect your CNI in person or have it delivered by post.
