    You’ll need to complete a [notice for civil partnership](/government/publications/notice-for-registration-of-civil-partnership-under-italian-law) form and a [civil partnership declaration](/government/publications/declaration-for-formation-of-civil-partnership-under-italian-law) form.

    You can download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.

    You must take the forms with you to your appointment.

You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%
