###Legalisation and translation

You’ll need to get your statutory declaration and CNI ’[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine) by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO).

You’ll also need to get your CNI [translated](/government/publications/italy-list-of-translators-and-interpreters) and sworn before the Italian courts or an Italian Justice of the Peace.
